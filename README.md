# php-self-destructing-message
A tiny one-page PHP script to be used anywhere, that allows you to create a message that self-destructs when viewed or after an amount of time. A very simple and minimal design without buttons or unnecessary form fields. Just open the page and start writing right away. It also supports simple markdown.
